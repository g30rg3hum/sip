# Sip - drink enough water

This app is targeted at the lack of simplicity of the current hydration reminder apps. No crazy mascots, no crazy challenges (as of yet at least) - just simple, effective reminders to take sips of water throughout the day, easily record water drank, and straight-forward analytics about your water drinking habits.

## Target platforms

The MVP will initially be an iOS app, but this will be extended by a MacOS app, where you will be able to receive reminders there (to target focused work sessions where you more easily forget to drink water).

## MVP Features

- Mobile app for now
- Notifications
- Widgets for tracking daily progress (and maybe quickly adding water drank)
- Simple UI screen to add water quickly
- Onboarding questions to get approximation for daily water intake target
- Simple analytics: streaks and monthly "Git contribution graphs" to see how well you're hitting your goals.
- Dark mode only for now

## Tech stack

- Expo and React Native
- NativeWind for styling
- TypeScript
- Expo SQLite (MVP device data storage)
- Supabase (for later auth when extending past MVP)
